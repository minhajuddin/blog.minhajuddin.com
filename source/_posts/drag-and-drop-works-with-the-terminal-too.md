You can just drag and drop files in your terminal to get the full path of the file. Then you can do whatever you want with it, e.g. in my case I had downloaded a google verification file, I just dragged it to my terminal and edited the command to scp it over to my server. This can be very useful when you have unwieldy filenames.
