title: software developer's obsession with ninjas and rockstars

We software developers are so obsessed with trying to be cool that we forget who
we are. I am sure many of you have seen phrases like *javascript ninja/C# ninja/
php rockstar developer (with a silhouette of a rockstar)* on various websites.  

**Think about what these phrases mean for a second.**  

Why the hell would I call myself a javascript ninja, instead of a javascript developer or a javascript hacker?  

Is it because javascript *ninja* sounds cooler?  

Does it mean that I would rather be a *ninja* than a javascript *developer*?  

I get pissed off whenever I see a guy who gets his body peirced or calls himself 
a rockstar developer or calls himself some ninja just to look cool.  

We are not ninjas or rockstars, we are programmers/developers/hackers and we
need to be proud of that. Intel gets this right: *Our rock stars are'nt like your
rockstars*.
