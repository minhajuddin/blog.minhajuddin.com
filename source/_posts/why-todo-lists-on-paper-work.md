I have used a lot of tools to manage my **TODO** lists, I even wrote one ([Taskr - Simple command line utility to manage your tasks](https://github.com/minhajuddin/taskr)). However, I keep coming back to *pen and paper*. I think I *get* it now, The biggest drawback of the Todo list apps I've used was that they made managing my Todo lists *easy*. As a result of which my lists started growing. When I use pen and paper, I *have* to copy everything to a new page *every single day*, and THAT is NOT easy. It makes me *think* which task is worth copying. At the end of the day, this is what makes my todo lists sane. I think I am going to stick to pen and paper for my Todo lists for a long time.
