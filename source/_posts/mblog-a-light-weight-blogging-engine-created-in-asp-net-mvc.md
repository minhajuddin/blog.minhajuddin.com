title: MBlog a light weight blogging engine created in asp.net mvc

Alright, I have posted a couple of *meta* blog posts, not very interesting to many. But, anyway, I just wanted to rant away on a few topics.
With that aside. I'll start a series of blog posts on developing web applications using asp.net mvc. 
I know there is a lot of information on the web already about asp.net mvc. This is just something which I am planning to do to better ... myself.

I am planning to wake up a dormant open source project of mine called [MBlog][1]. It already has some code in it. 
But I am planning to start anew. And just to keep things a little interesting I will try to target the Mono framework. 
I've always wanted to see if I could get my apps to run on Mono. I have heard a lot of good stuff about it. 
If I can get this project working on Mono, I'll definitely create more apps on Mono. Because Mono stands for everything free ;)
I'll try to stick to the following stack:

 1. ASP.NET MVC
 2. NHibernate
 3. Spark View Engine
 4. StructureMap for IoC
 5. Mono

Let's see how this one goes ;)
