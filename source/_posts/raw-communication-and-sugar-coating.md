I have read *[How to Win Friends & Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439167346/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1439167346&linkCode=as2&tag=httpminhajuco-20)*
a few years ago, It's an amazing book filled with great advice on how to talk to people.
However, I have ended up using it on the wrong people, I've found myself sugar coating a lot of stuff when I communicate.

**Sugar coating stuff is great when you are talking to strangers or people whom you 
don't communicate with a lot. But, when you do that with your family, the people 
you work with, it increases the noise in your communication**. For instance, if I
compliment my mother on the food, she just thinks I am trying to be nice, because 
I always complement her. Nowadays, everyone is trying to peel of the layer of my bullshit sugar coating 
to see what I mean. It has reached a point where, If I don't talk to my folks for a day 
they think I am mad at them, because of something they did. 

I read something about this a while ago, but I didn't understand the full extent
of it. It's like the story about the author who wrote: 

>The hero opened a blue door and walked into the room. 

The reader thinks blue door signifies that the
hero must be feeling down. Even when it's just a bloody blue door.
It doesn't have any frigging meaning to it. People end up trying to read between the
lines even when there is nothing to read.

I have learnt a valuable lesson from all of this. **Don't make it difficult for
people to understand what you are saying.** Especially your family, friends and
colleagues. You might end up hurting them without even knowing. **And, end up 
an unconscious player in a game of hide and seek with your words**
