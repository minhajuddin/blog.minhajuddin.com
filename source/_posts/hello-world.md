title: Hello world!

Well, that sounds too cliched, But what the heck I am a programmer!

Now, after listening to [@shansxelman's][1] presentation on social media for developers at [neuronspark.com][2], I have planned to try blogging. 
This is not a new thing for me, I have already done some blogging (@ [http://minhajuddin.blogspot.com][3]) when I was working on a tool called datastage. 
But that was on some thing which was, let's say not that fun. I quit blogging right when I dumped Datastage.

After jumping into the exciting world of web applications, there was so much to learn! I kept thinking that I would start blogging once things got a bit steady (read "when I had learnt everything"). But, now it seems that things never get steady and you never stop learning in the ".com world". All I needed was a little push, which Scott thankfully provided.
You aren't supposed to put in a lot of code in your "Hello, World!" code, so I am gonna end this post right away! On a side note I created this <del>web page</del> blog post using a simple text editor. In the future I'll be posting blogs using a more advanced framework which I am working on @[MBlog][4]. It's being developed using [ASP.NET MVC][5] w00t!
