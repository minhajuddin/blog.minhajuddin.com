Hey all, My last post was about three months ago and that was the time when 
I! thought that I would start blogging full time. I meant every word of what I said. 
But, hey, that's not what happened! I didn't blog for a full 3 months, that is like a .. decade in the blogosphere.

Anyway, the reasons for this are quite simple. Being a programmer, I thought it would be 
<strong>awesome </strong>if I had my own blogging application. And how hard can a blogging app be.
Well, it's not as easy as it sounds. So, my first tip to become a good blogger, Nah a <strong>blogger </strong>
is, don't try to build your own blogging application to host your blog. Even if you <em>think</em> you are the 
smartest man on this planet ( I never thought I was ). Try to make posting blogs as simple as it can be. Ridiculously simple. 
Only then you'll be able to post blog posts frequently.

That's what I did, I setup wordpress on one of my linux servers. Made a few tweaks and bam, there was my blog. 
I am hopeful that I will be able to post more often. But, anyway, that's Tip #1 to become a blogger.


Till next time!
