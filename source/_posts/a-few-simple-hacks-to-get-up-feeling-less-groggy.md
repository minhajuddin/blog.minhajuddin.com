I've been trying to get up early for almost 6 years now, I have had bits of success in the past. I learnt about the [Stages of sleep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#Sleep_stages), about [REM Sleep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep) and everything I could get my hands on. From Wikipedia

>Many animals and some people **tend to wake, or experience a period of very light sleep**, for a short time immediately after a bout of REM. 

There are devices like the [Sleep tracker](http://www.sleeptracker.com/), which track your sleep cycles, They are a bit expensive.

In the last few days I've been doing these which I have helped me:

 1. Read a book for a few minutes in the bed.
 2. Set the alarm  6 hours 15 minutes from the time I sleep. The average sleep cycle for a person is 90 minutes long, so 4 cycles ~ 6 hours. However, the sleep cycle is not exactly 90  minutes for everyone, I've found that 6 hours 15 minutes works for me. You may have to experiment a little for this.
 3. This, I think has contributed most to my less groggy awakenings: **Set the volume of the alarm to a very low setting**. What I think this does is **wake me up only if I am in light sleep**. Having a loud alarm which can 'penetrate' through your deep cycles is not a good thing!

You guys can let me know if these work for you.
