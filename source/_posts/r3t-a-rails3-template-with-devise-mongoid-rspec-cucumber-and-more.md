Lately I have been prototyping a lot. And the initial rails wireup with all my
gems was becoming a pain. I checked out [RailsWizard][1] It's an awesome app,
and for most of the requirements it would work right out of the box.

I needed a template with a little more customization, so I created a rails
project wired it up and put it on [github][2]. So, now, whenever I need to do
some quick prototyping, I don't get distracted by the initial wireup. I just
clone the repo and start banging out code :)
